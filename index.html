                Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία,
                -logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or
                services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the
                knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for
                operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by
                taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred
                to as technology systems or technological systems.

                Way To Simplest
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of
                how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the
                invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in
                historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical
                barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

                Effect And Relative.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global
                economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted
                by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment.
                Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of
                technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and
                the challenges of bioethics.
